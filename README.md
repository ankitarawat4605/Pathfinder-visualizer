# Pathfinder-visualizer
A web-based Pathfinding Visualizer that allows users to interactively visualize pathfinding algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra. Users can set start/end points, add walls, and watch algorithms explore the grid step by step.

## Features
- Visualize BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra algorithms
- Interactive grid with walls and start/end points
- Step-by-step exploration to understand algorithm behavior
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- React.js
- Git & GitHub
